[Shor's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) invented by Peter Shor in 1994, and it's used to find the prime factors of an integer.

It's specifically written for a quantum computer, as classical computers would a take very long time to find the period, specific component of the algorithm.

For more info, one can check this Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUwZZaI5u0c)

This is just a simulation of the algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook...

Cheers
